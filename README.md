5. **Access in Code**: Use the `ORDERS_KV` binding in your application to interact with the KV store.

  - `id`: Unique identifier for each order.
  - `productId`: Identifier for the product associated with the order.
  - `amount`: The amount for the order.
  - `status`: Current status of the order (e.g., pending, completed, cancelled).
